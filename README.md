Here is a link to a Car Insurance's files project I had to work on that when the user enters their information it will  give them an esimated quote. 
The program offers multiple factors such as speeding tickets, DUIs, year, and make of the vehicle.

For another project using C# I had to create a game of 21 and runs fully off the console. All the files are attached as follows.
